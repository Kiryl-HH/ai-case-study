# Darktrace

## Overview and Origin

> [Darktrace](https://darktrace.com)</b> 

* Darktrace has been building a new model for cybersecurity since 2013. 

* Darktrace was founded in 2013 by Poppy Gustafsson, Dave Palmer, Emily Orton, Jack Stockdale and Nicole Eagan. The founders were leading a team of a world-class team of mathematicians from the University of Cambridge and AI experts, who were working on some ground-breaking applications of AI, experimenting with giving machines a sense of self.

### Powered By Ground-Breaking Self-Learning AI, Darktrace Empowers Bespoke Security Unique To Each Customer Based On Continuous Visibility Into An Organization’s Entire Digital Ecosystem. 

* The Darktrace ActiveAI Security Platform delivers a proactive approach to cyber resilience, providing preemptive visibility into security posture, real-time detection, and autonomous response to known and unknown threats, and correlating beyond boundaries — securing the business across cloud, email, identities, OT, endpoints and network.

* The Darktrace Immune System is a market-leading cyber security technology platform that uses AI to detect sophisticated cyber-threats, from insider threat and criminal espionage, to ransomware and nation-state attacks. Analogous to the human immune system, Darktrace learns the ‘digital DNA’ of the organization, and constantly adapts to changing environments. Self-learning, self-healing security has arrived.

*  Darktrace has raised $50 million in Series E funding. The round was led by Vitruvian Partners. Previous investors KKR and TenEleven Ventures also participated.
The company has raised $229.5 million in total known funding. That includes the company’s $75 million Series D in July 2011.
